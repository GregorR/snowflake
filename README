This is Snowflake, a highly experimental Linux distribution based on the musl C
library, with a per-process view of the /usr filesystem, such that users may
choose to have different perceptions of which packages are available on the
system. Snowflake runs on i[3456]86, x86_64 and ARM.

Within Snowflake, users may choose to change their view of which packages and
versions are installed. For instance, if you do not expose gcc in the default
set of packages, a user may compile packages like so:

$ gcc
sh: gcc: not found
$ with gcc
$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
$ gcc test.c
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!

To build snowflake, make a config.sh (or use the existing one), and use the
build scripts in core/, in this order:

* ./buildcc.sh: Builds a cross-compiler targeting linux-musl. Due to a
  confluence of bugs, including possibly a bug in my GCC patch (which I'm
  investigating) as well as a pseudo-bug in GCC (GCC 4.7.0 can only be
  cross-built with GCC >=4.7.0), you currently need a cross-compiler for
  linux-musl. It's generally a good idea since it avoids pollution anyway. If
  at some point I figure out how to get GCC 4.7.0 to reliably compile with the
  musl-gcc wrapper instead of a cross-compiler, this step will not be strictly
  necessary, but will still be recommended. As a point of comparison, note that
  most other musl distributions require that you compile GCC 3.6 for musl
  before compiling GCC 4, so the number of GCC compiles is the same.

* ./build-gcc-deps.sh: Builds prerequisites to build GCC for the guest. This
  needs to be done after buildcc and before buildroot.

* ./buildroot.sh: Builds a Snowflake root filesystem.

* ./bootstraproot.sh: Builds the last few packages from within Snowflake. Note
  that this will only work if your host kernel supports the necessary modules,
  otherwise you will need to run Snowflake in a VM and bootstrap with
  /src/bootstrap.sh.

* ./enter-chroot.sh: chroots into a Snowflake root filesystem.

* ./mk-hd-image.sh: Builds a Snowflake HD image from a root filesystem.

It is possible to build out-of-source. To do so, set the environment variable
SNOWFLAKE_BASE to the absolute path of core/, then run the scripts as usual.

Snowflake supports the NetBSD pkgsrc as a source of packages. The integration
is imperfect but working. To include pkgsrc, set WITH_PKGSRC=yes in your
config.sh. To use it, just `with pkgsrc` then build in /var/pkgsrc.
Installation will automatically go into separated packages in /pkg.

The default root password is "snowflake".


Snowflake can run on ARM, MIPS and PowerPC, though these ports are considerably
less tested. Currently pkgsrc does not work on musl+MIPS, but other
combinations seems to work. A native compile on one of these systems should
work just like a native compile on any other system. To cross-compile Snowflake
for them:

* Your config.sh must specify one of
  ARCH=arm
  ARCH=mips
  ARCH=powerpc

* On PowerPC, config.sh must additionally specify
  GCC_BOOTSTRAP_CONFFLAGS="--with-long-double-64 --enable-secureplt"
  GCC_CONFFLAGS="--with-long-double-64 --enable-secureplt"

* Up to buildroot is as normal. After buildroot asks you to sudo, it will have
  some errors. These are normal.

* Use mk-hd-image.sh to create an image, even though it hasn't been finalized
  or bootstrapped.

* The image should be usable in qemu. Example commands are provided in
  core/qemu.

* Run /src/bootstrap.sh to finish bootstrapping.

Currently MIPS has bugs related to input, it seems to buffer three characters
at a time. Just hit ^O three times when you want a command to execute until the
bug is fixed.
